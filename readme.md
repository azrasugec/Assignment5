# Assignment #5 â€“ Documentation with Sphinx

In this assignment, I used **Sphinx** to generate automatic documentation for my Python project. Documentation is a key step in building long-lasting and maintainable software.

The steps I followed include:

- Installing Sphinx
- Creating the documentation skeleton
- Generating `.rst` files from Python code
- Exploring and applying at least two different themes
- Building and viewing HTML output

Below are the detailed steps with explanations and images. A summary table is included at the end.

## Step 1 â€“ Installing Sphinx

To start documenting my Python project, I first installed **Sphinx**:

```bash
python -m pip install sphinx
```

Sphinx and its dependencies were already installed on my system. You may see output indicating the packages are already satisfied.

## Step 2 â€“ Setting up the Sphinx Project Structure

After installing Sphinx, I created a documentation folder and initialized it with:

```bash
mkdir docs
cd docs
sphinx-quickstart
```

During the quickstart, I entered project name, author, and language options.

## Step 3 â€“ Encountered Error: `make` or `make.bat` Not Found

While trying to build the documentation using Git Bash, I received the following errors:

```bash
make.bat html
bash: make.bat: command not found

make html
bash: make: command not found
```

This happened because `make.bat` must be run in Command Prompt, not in Git Bash.

## Step 4 â€“ Building HTML Output Successfully

I switched to **Command Prompt (cmd.exe)** and used:

```cmd
make.bat html
```

This time, the documentation was successfully built into `_build/html`.

## Step 5 â€“ Viewing the Generated HTML Documentation

I opened the generated HTML page:

```text
_build/html/index.html
```

This displayed the default Sphinx output using the Alabaster theme.

## Step 6 â€“ Changing the Theme to Alabaster

In the `conf.py` file, I modified the theme:

```python
html_theme = 'alabaster'
```

## Step 7 â€“ Trying the Read the Docs Theme

Then I tested a different layout by switching to:

```python
html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'
```

Make sure this theme is installed:

```bash
pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
```

---

## Step 8 â€“ Final Output with sphinx_rtd_theme

After applying the Read the Docs theme, I rebuilt the docs and viewed the updated design.

## Step 9 â€“ Trying the Classic Theme

For comparison, I also tested Sphinxâ€™s built-in `classic` theme:

```python
html_theme = 'classic'
```
